I developed this little game in C language during my first year at university while I was taking my first computer programming exam.
In this game the user represented by the square must eat all the points without being eaten by the ghosts to clear the way to defeat the final monster and end the game.

How to run:
```
gcc CGame.c -o GGame.exe
```
